# 🛂 Passport Automation System

A UML-based academic project that models the complete workflow of applying, verifying, and issuing a passport using **ArgoUML**. This system reduces manual effort, provides a structured process, and ensures secure data handling through multi-stage verification.

---

## 📖 Introduction

The **Passport Automation System** is designed to simplify and automate the process of applying for a passport. The system allows an applicant to register online and submit personal details. These details are verified by different authorities—namely the Passport Administrator, Regional Administrator, and Police—before the passport is approved and issued.

This project focuses on modeling the structure and flow of the system using **UML diagrams** created in **ArgoUML**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The project consists of multiple interacting components that represent real-world entities involved in passport issuance:

1. **Applicant** logs in and submits personal details.
2. **System** stores the data and initiates the first round of verification.
3. **Passport Administrator** verifies and forwards details.
4. **Police** performs background verification and sends a report.
5. **Regional Administrator** does the final validation.
6. If all validations pass, the passport is approved and issued.

## 📤 Final Output (Result)

- 📌 Applicant successfully submits application online.
- 📌 All entities (Admin, Police, Regional Office) verify and update application status.
- ✅ Once verified, the passport is issued and the applicant is notified.
- 📁 All application and verification data is securely stored in the system database.
