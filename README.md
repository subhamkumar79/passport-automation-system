# Passport Automation System

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The **Passport Automation System** is designed to streamline and automate the passport application and verification process. It eliminates manual work, reduces processing time, and ensures secure and structured workflow through multiple verification layers involving the applicant, passport office, regional administrators, and police department.

This project is modeled using **ArgoUML**, employing standard UML diagrams such as Use Case, Class, Sequence, Activity, Statechart, and Package diagrams.

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To design and model a Passport Automation System using the **ArgoUML** tool, focusing on minimizing manual effort, improving verification accuracy, and accelerating passport issuance.

---

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

1. The current passport issuance process is largely manual, leading to inefficiencies and delays.
2. The system must allow applicants to register and submit details online.
3. The application should undergo automated verification before reaching authorities.
4. Administrators should be able to validate and approve details with the support of police verification.
5. Upon successful verification, the system should issue the passport and update records.

## ðŸ‘¥ Actors Involved

- Applicant
- Passport Administrator
- Regional Administrator (Ministry of External Affairs)
- Police
- System Database

## ðŸ›  UML Diagrams

### 1. **Use Case Diagram**
Outlines system interactions between the applicant, authorities, and database. Key use cases include login, submitting details, verifying information, and issuing the passport.

### 2. **Class Diagram**
Represents the structure of system classes such as `Applicant`, `PassportAdministrator`, `Police`, `RegionalAdministrator`, and `Database`, with their attributes and operations.

### 3. **Sequence Diagram**
Depicts the step-by-step interaction flow, from applicant login to final passport issuance, including verification processes by multiple actors.

### 4. **Activity Diagram**
Visualizes the workflow of the system, including login, submission, verification, decision-making (issue or penalty), and final delivery.

### 5. **Statechart Diagram**
Illustrates the different states of a passport application: login, submission, verification, and issuance.

### 6. **Package Diagram**
Describes the modular structure of the systemâ€”UI, Applicant, Administration, Police, and Databaseâ€”grouped into logical packages for maintainability.
